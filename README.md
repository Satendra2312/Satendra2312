## üí° Ideas for Animation

Here are some ideas for adding animations to your README:

1.  **Profile Picture Animation:** Add a subtle rotation or scaling animation to your profile picture.
2.  **Skill Icons Animation:** Animate the skill icons to bounce, rotate, or slide in on page load. Consider using a library like `react-spring` (if using React) or CSS animations.
3.  **Typing Animation:** Use a typing animation for the introduction ("Hi, I'm Satendra Kumar") to simulate real-time text input.
4.  **Link Hover Effects:** Enhance social media badges/links (Portfolio, GitHub, Email, etc.) with hover effects such as color changes, scaling, or subtle shadow effects.
5.  **Section Title Animation:** Animate section titles ("Technical Skills," "Professional Experience," etc.) to fade in, slide in, or use a similar entrance animation.
6.  **Progress Bars**: Animate progress bars for the skills section.

Remember, the most effective animations are subtle and enhance the user experience without being distracting.
